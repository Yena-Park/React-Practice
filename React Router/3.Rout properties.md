Route Properties
================
All three render methods will ahve route properties passed down from the Route component.Here are the route properties that are passed down as props:
* match
* location
* history   

You can access them through props, just like any other React property:
```javascript
const About = (props) => {
  console.log(props.match)
  // Object {path: "/about", url: "/about", isExact: true, params: Object}
  console.log(props.location)
  // Object {pathname: "/about", search: "", hash: "", state: undefined}
  console.log(props.history)
  // Object {length: 1, action: "POP", location: Object}
  return (
    <div>
      About
    </div>
)}

const App = () => (
  <div>
    <BrowserRouter>
      <Route path="/about" component = {About}/>
    </BrowserRouter>
  </div>
);
```

You can also access them through ES6 destructuring:
```javascript
const App = () => (
  <div>
    <BrowserRouter>
      <Route path="/about" render={ ({match,location,history}) => { 
        console.log(match)
        // Object {path: "/about", url: "/about", isExact: true, params: Object}
        console.log(location)
        // Object {pathname: "/about", search: "", hash: "", state: undefined}
        console.log(history)
        // Object {length: 1, action: "POP", location: Object}
        return (
          <div>About</div>
        )}
      }/>
    </BrowserRouter>
  </div>
);
```
match
-----
A ```match``` object is passed down to all components rendered from Route components as a property. The match object is null when there is no match, but contains useful information when a match occurs. The match object contains the following information about a matched path that caused a component to be rendered:
* params (object) - contains key/value pairs of the dynamic segments that are used in the path pattern (e.g. {userId = 123} when path = “/user/:userId” and the URL is "/user/123")
* isExact (boolean) - true if the URL is an exact match with the path property
* path (string) - the path property of the route component. Useful for building nested routes
*url (string) - the matched portion of the URL. Useful for building nested Links

location
--------
A ```location``` object is passed down to all components rendered from Route components as a property. The location object contains the following information about the path that was rendered:
* pathname (string) - the full path of the URL
* search (string) - the URL query string
* hash (string) - the URL hash fragment
* state (object) - the current state, if a state was provided to history.push(path, [state]), otherwise undefined

history
-------
A ```history``` object is passed down to all components rendered from Route components as a property. The history object contains the following information about the path that was rendered:
* length (number) - The number of entries in the history stack
* action (string) - (PUSH, POP, or REPLACE)
* location (object) - see location

It also has the following methods:
* push(path, [state]) - (function) Pushes a new entry onto the history
* replace(path, [state]) - (function) Replaces the current entry on the history stack
* go(n) - (function) Moves the pointer in the history stack by n entries
* goBack() - (function) Equivalent to go(-1)
* goForward() - (function) Equivalent to go(1)
* block(prompt) - (function) Prevents navigation (see the history docs)

URL Parameters
==============
URL parameters are segments of your URL path that can vary and be parsed from the URL. To define a segment of your path to be a URL param, add a colon in front of the segment name:
```javascript
 <Route path="/userId/:id" render={(props) => <div>Home</div>}/>
```
The “:id” portion of the URL path can now vary and the route will still match. For example "/userId/123" and “/userId/abc”, will both cause a match.

You can access the URL param value by using the match.params object that is passed down to the rendered component:
```javascript
const User = ({match}) => {
 return (
   <div>
     UserId: {match.params.id} //this will show the id entered in the URL path
   </div>
)}

const App = () => (
 <div>
   <BrowserRouter>
     <Route path="/userId/:id" component = {User}/>
   </BrowserRouter>
 </div>
);

Nested Routes
=============
It is pretty straight forward to nest Route components within each other. The ```match.url``` property is useful if you want to add path segments onto the original matched url. For example, if you want to add additional Route components within a component rendered from an original Route component do the following:
```javascript
const Info = ({match}) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <Route path="{match.url + "/phone"}" render={(props) => <div>Phone: 123 456 7890</div>}/> // renders when URL = /info/phone
      <Route path="{match.url + "/email"}" render={(props) => <div>Email: email@email.com</div>}/> renders when URL = /info/email
      <Route path="{match.url + "/address"}" render={(props) => <div>Address: 123 Address</div>}/> renders when URL = /info/address
    </div>
)}

const App = () => (
  <div>
    <BrowserRouter>
      <Route path="/info" component = {Info}/>
    </BrowserRouter>
  </div>
);
```
