What is React Router
====================
React Router is a third party library that is used to handle the routing needs of your React application. With React Router, you can easily render different components based on the path of your URL. Take a look at this simple exxample that shows off what React Router can do:

```javascript
import React from "react";
import { render } from "react-dom";
import { BrowserRouter, Route, Link } from "react-router-dom";

const Home = () => <div>Home</div>;
const About = () => <div>About</div>;
const Users = ({ match }) => <div>{match.url}</div>;

const App = () => (
  <BrowserRouter>
    <div>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <Link to="/">Home</Link>
        </li>
        <li>
          <Link to="/about">About</Link>
        </li>
        <li>
          <Link to="/users">Users</Link>{" "}
        </li>
      </ul>
      <hr />
      <Route exact path="/" component={Home} />
      <Route path="/about" component={About} />
      <Route path="/users" component={Users} />
    </div>
  </BrowserRouter>
);

render(<App />, document.getElementById("root"));
```
