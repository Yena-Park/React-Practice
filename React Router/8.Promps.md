Prompts
=======
Prompt
------
The Prompt component will send a message to the user if the user ever navigates away from the page.

We can import the Prompt component with:
```javascript
import { Prompt} from 'react-router-dom'
```

We can reference the Prompt component using the ```<Prompt>``` tag.
```javascript
<Prompt message="Are you sure you want to leave?"/>
```

message
-------
```javascript
The Prompt component has a message attribute that contains a string that will be displayed to the user when they are attempting to navigate away from the page.
```

when
----
The when attribute is a boolean that can be used to enable or disable the Prompt component. Set it to false when you want to disable the Prompt component and allow the user the navigate away without seeing a Prompt. The when attribute is set to true by default.
```javascript
var notSaved = true
   <Prompt when={notSaved} message="Are you sure you want to leave without saving?"/>
```
