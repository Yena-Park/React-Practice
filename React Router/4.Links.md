Link
====
The Link component is used to provide a clickable link that will change that will change the URL of the page.

We can import the LInk component with:
```javascript
import { Link } from 'react-router-dom'
```

We can reference the Link component using the <Link> tag.
```javascript
<Link to="/somewhere">Somewhere</Link>
```

to
--
The Link component has a to property that specifies what the URL will change to when the Link component is clicked. Any string value can be passed to the to property including string values with queries and hashtags.

Example Link Components:
```javascript
const App = () => (
  <div>
    <BrowserRouter> 
      <Link to="/a/b/c/d">Path</Link>
      <Link to="/#clothes">Hashtag</Link>
      <Link to="/items?id=123">Query</Link>
    </BrowserRouter>
  </div>
);
```

replace
-------
The Link component has a replace component which causes the Link to replace the current entry in the history stack instead of adding a new one when clicked.
```javascript
<Link to="somewhere" replace />
```
