Switches
========
Switch
------
The Switch component contains several Route components and will exclusively render the first route that is a match. Without a Switch component, multiple Routes may be rendered if multiple matches are detected.

We can import the Switch component with:
```javascript
import { Switch, Route } from 'react-router-dom'
```
We can reference the Switch component using the ```<Switch>``` tag.
```javascript
<Switch>
  <Route exact path="/" component={Home}/>
  <Route path="/about" component={About}/>
  <Route path="/users/allUsers" component={User}/>
  <Route path="/users/:id" component={User}/>
</Switch>
```

Default Route
-------------
It is a common practice to have the last Route within a Switch component be a route that always renders. This way, you can display a default component if all other routes fail.
```javascript
<Switch>
 <Route exact path="/" component={Home}/>
 <Route path="/about" component={About}/>
 <Route path="/users/:id" component={User}/>
 <Route component={DefaultRoute}/> //if no other routes match, this route will render for sure
</Switch>
```
