What is Redux
-------------
Redux is a third party state management library that makes it easier to access and modify your application state. Redux is often used with React, but it can be used with any other front end libray as well.

Redux implifies state management by using the following 3 concepts:

* Store - a single object that holds all your application state
* Actions - categorized events that trigger a change to your application state
* Reducers - functional difinitions of how the application state should chage

These concepts work together i the following way:

1. All application data is held inside a store
2. A user or timed event triggers an action to be dispatched.
3. The reducer figures out what type of action was dispatched and updates the sotre accordingly
4. The store now contains updated data.
